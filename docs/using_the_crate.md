## Using The Crate

[(Click me to go back to the main readme)](../README.md)

### Registering the [Plugin](../src/bevy_card_plugin.rs)
First, you should add [`BevyCardPlugin`](../src/bevy_card_plugin.rs), it has a `::default()` implementation but can be reconfigured, for example:
  ```rust
  app.add_plugins(
    BevyCardPlugin {
      card_hover_height: 40.0,
      ..default()
    },
  );
  ```

### Spawning [Cards](../src/cards/card.rs)
The basic functionality derived from Bevy Picking is added to Cards automatically.
It's recommended to instantiate a card using [card bundle](../src/cards/card_bundle.rs)s:
  ```rust
  commands.spawn((
    CardBundle::new(Transform::default()),
    Sprite {
        image: asset_server.load("your card sprite path here"),
        ..default ()
    },
  ));
  ```
Cards are named automatically by the [card_namer](../src/cards/card_namer.rs).
When the `Card` component is removed from an entity, it's automatically removed from it's owner line if it had any.

### Spawning [Card Lines](../src/cards/card_lines/card_line.rs)
Cards can live on a card line, that'll allow you to reorder them and keep them neatly organized.
All you need to instantiate a card line is:
  ```rust
  commands
    .spawn(CardLineBundle::from_transform(Transform::default()));
```
Or more specifically using [`from_card_line`](../src/cards/card_lines/card_line_bundle.rs):
  ```rust
  commands
    .spawn(CardLineBundle::from_card_line(
        CardLine::default()
          .with_origin(
            Transform::from_translation(location.into())
                .with_rotation(Quat::from_rotation_z(rotation)),
          )
          .with_max_cards(MAX_CARDS)
          .with_card_origin_gap(60.0),
    ));
  ```

### Using [Card Line Requests](../src/cards/card_lines/event.rs)
Although you could interact with the entities directly, you can spare yourself some boilerplate
by firing events using `MessageWriter<CardLineRequest>`, already listened to by the plugin.
Each [`CardLineRequest`](../src/cards/card_lines/event.rs) contains the entity of the line to which it'll be applied and a request type with relevant additional data if there's any.
The variants of `CardLineRequestType` are as follows:

| Variant                  | Role                                                                      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RaiseLine`              | Raises the card line to it's relative up                                  |
| `LowerLine`              | Lowers the card line back to place after being raised                     |
| `AddToLine`              | Inserts the card to the line if within capacity                           |
| `RemoveFromLine`         | Removes the card from the line if it was there                            |
| `BatchAddToLine`         | Inserts the cards to the line if within capacity, starting from the first |
| `BatchRemoveFromLine`    | Removes the cards from the line if they were there                        |
| `RemoveAllCardsFromLine` | Removes all the cards in the line                                         |


### Card [Tags](../src/cards/tags.rs)
Cards are being tagged for easier queries when they're hovered, picked and dragged.
`Hovered` and `Dragged` are removed once the status is done, `Picked` is toggled by clicking.
This way you can, for example, get all hovered card with queries like:
`
  Query<&Card, With<Hovered>>
`

| Tag       | Visually                                                                                      |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Hovered` | The card would hover up a bit                                                                 |
| `Dragged` | The card would follow your cursor, ignoring line movements, going back to place once released |
| `Picked`  | The card would stay on hover height, ignoring the cursor leaving its area                     |

### Workflow Example
Let's spawn a line and add a few cards to it,
see [cards_on_a_line.rs](../examples/cards_on_a_line.rs) for another example of that scenario.

First, let's spawn a defaultly-configured line in the middle of the screen.
  ```rust
  let line_entity = commands
    .spawn(CardLineBundle::from_transform(Transfrom::default())).id();
  ```

Now, let's spawn three cards, sending a request to add each to a line.
Sending the requests separately ensures the line stays within capacity, leaving out the last cards to be spawned if any.
The shape of the loop is as follows:
  ```rust
  for _ in 0..3 {
    let card_entity = commands.spawn(( ... )).id();
    card_line_request_writer.write(CardLineRequest { ... });
  }
  ```

An example for card spawning would be:
  ```rust
  let card_entity = commands
    .spawn((
        Sprite {
          image: asset_server.load("path to your card sprite here"),
          ..default()
        },
        CardBundle::new(Transform::default()),
      )).id();
```
With the appropriate addition request:
```rust
  card_line_request_writer.write(CardLineRequest {
    line: line_entity,
    request_type: CardLineRequestType::AddToLine { card_entity },
  });
  ```

Ending up with:
  ```rust
  let line_entity = commands
    .spawn(CardLineBundle::from_transform(Transfrom::default())).id();
  for _ in 0..3 {
    let card_entity = commands
        .spawn((
          Sprite {
            image: asset_server.load("path to your card sprite here"),
            ..default()
          },
          CardBundle::new(Transform::default()),
        )).id();
    card_line_request_writer.write(CardLineRequest {
      line: line_entity,
      request_type: CardLineRequestType::AddToLine { card_entity },
    });
  }
  ```
